# terminal-x

This repository contains a monorepo skeleton for a modular Discord bot platform.

## Packages
- `@terminal-x/bot` – placeholder for the Discord bot runtime.
- `@terminal-x/api` – placeholder for the API service.
- `@terminal-x/shared` – shared utilities and types.
- `@terminal-x/web` – placeholder for the web admin panel.

This is an initial scaffold; full feature implementation is pending.
